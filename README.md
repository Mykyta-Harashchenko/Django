Quotes Manager Django Project
Quotes Manager is a Django-based web application that allows users to manage and interact with quotes, authors, and tags. The app supports features like selecting a quote of the day, retrieving a random quote, and categorizing quotes with tags. This project provides both a web interface and API endpoints for managing quotes and authors.

This project allows users to:
Add, edit, and delete quotes.
Assign quotes to authors.
Tag quotes for easier categorization.
Set a "Quote of the Day" (automatically displayed each day).
Retrieve a random quote at any time.
Filter quotes by tags or authors.

The project leverages Django for backend logic, with Django REST Framework for API support and JWT tokens for authentication.

Features

Tagging System:
Tags help categorize quotes. Users can filter quotes by one or more tags.

Author Management:
Manage authors who contribute quotes. Each author can have multiple quotes.

User Authentication:
Users can log in, register, and authenticate using JWT tokens for secure sessions.

Admin Interface:
The Django admin interface allows easy management of authors, quotes, and tags.
